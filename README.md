# 30 Projects Challenge 

## About This Repository

This summer, I'm teaching myself how to ACTUALLY code so that I can make my own meaningful projects and get internship ready! At the very least, I get a good WAM next sem and if I'm lucky, I bag an internship XD

## 60-Day Goals

For the next 60 days, my goals are:
* Learn the fundamentals of SQL
* Master the Algorithms from FOA
* Code 30 real projects

## Projects

This repository contains all 30 projects I'm building throughout this challenge. Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other necessary files.

### Project List

1. **Blog Page** - A responsive blog page design
2. *More projects coming soon...*
